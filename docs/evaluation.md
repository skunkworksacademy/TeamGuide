</div>

### Key Stakeholder Perspectives

| Stakeholder | Focus Areas | Collection Methods |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Learners** | Usability, engagement, perceived value, clarity | Surveys, interviews, focus groups, usage data |
| **Instructors** | Teachability, alignment with objectives, support materials | Structured feedback forms, teaching journals, workshops |
| **Subject Matter Experts** | Accuracy, currency, completeness, depth | Expert reviews, validation sessions, advisory panels |

| **Industry Partners** | Relevance to workplace, skills alignment | Advisory boards, field testing, employment outcomes |
| **Support Staff** | Implementation issues, technical problems | Help desk logs, support tickets, implementation reports |

### Feedback Instrument Design

1. **Survey Design Principles**
   - Keep surveys concise (5-10 minutes to complete)
   - Balance question types (Likert scales, multiple choice, open-ended)
   - Use neutral language to avoid bias
   - Focus on actionable information
   - Include questions about both strengths and areas for improvement

2. **Learner Survey Template**

```markdown
## Module Feedback Survey

### Content Quality (Scale: 1-5)
- The content was clearly presented
- Examples and illustrations helped my understanding
- The material was up-to-date and relevant
- The difficulty level was appropriate

### Learning Experience (Scale: 1-5)
- Activities and exercises reinforced key concepts
- I could easily navigate through the materials
- Technical aspects functioned properly
- I felt engaged throughout the module

### Learning Outcomes (Scale: 1-5)
- I achieved the stated learning objectives
- I can apply what I learned to real-world situations
- I feel confident in my understanding of the topic
- The assessments accurately measured my knowledge

### Open-Ended Questions
- What aspects of this module were most valuable to your learning?
- What specific improvements would make this module more effective?
- What questions do you still have about this topic?
- What additional support would help you apply these concepts?
```

### Feedback Collection Timing

Implement a structured schedule for gathering feedback at key points:

1. **Pre-launch Testing**
   - Alpha testing with internal team
   - Beta testing with representative learner sample
   - Expert review by subject matter specialists

2. **Active Learning Phase**
   - Quick pulse checks during learning (1-2 questions)
   - Mid-point feedback at natural break points
   - Immediate feedback on assessments and activities

3. **Post-completion Review**
   - End-of-module comprehensive surveys
   - Delayed follow-up (2-4 weeks later) for retention and application
   - Longitudinal tracking for long-term impact

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Continuous technical issue reporting
   - Periodic content review cycles
   - Regular comparative benchmark analysis
