   - Speak clearly and somewhat slower than conversation
   - Show enthusiasm through voice variation and energy

3. **Video Structure Template**
   ```
   1. Hook/Relevance Statement (20-30 seconds)
      - Attention-grabbing opening
      - Relevance to students' learning or goals
   
   2. Learning Objectives (30 seconds)
      - Clear statements of what students will gain
   
   3. Content Presentation (3-8 minutes)
      - Key concepts with examples
      - Visual support for complex ideas
      - Real-world applications
   
   4. Summary/Synthesis (1 minute)
