# Best Practices for Online Teaching

## Engagement Strategies

### Building Community
- **Introduction Activities**: Start with icebreakers and personal introductions
- **Regular Communication**: Maintain consistent presence through announcements and updates
- **Discussion Facilitation**: Pose thought-provoking questions and guide meaningful conversations
- **Small Group Work**: Create opportunities for peer collaboration in smaller teams
- **Virtual Office Hours**: Schedule regular availability for one-on-one support

### Active Learning Techniques
- **Interactive Lectures**: Break up content delivery with engagement prompts
- **Case Studies**: Present real-world scenarios for analysis and discussion
- **Simulations**: Provide opportunities to practice skills in realistic contexts
- **Polling and Surveys**: Gather input and opinions throughout sessions
- **Collaborative Documents**: Use shared workspaces for concurrent contribution

### Maintaining Attention
- **Chunking Content**: Break materials into 7-10 minute segments
- **Varied Media**: Alternate between video, text, discussion, and activities
- **Clear Transitions**: Signal shifts between topics and activities explicitly
- **Retrieval Practice**: Include frequent recall opportunities
- **Storytelling**: Use narrative techniques to create compelling content

## Synchronous Session Best Practices

### Before the Session
- Test technology in advance
- Distribute materials and pre-work at least 24 hours ahead
- Send clear connection instructions
- Prepare backup plans for technical issues

### During the Session
- Start with a warm welcome and clear agenda
- Establish participation expectations
- Use varied interaction methods
- Monitor chat for questions
- Incorporate regular breaks for sessions over 60 minutes
- Summarize key points before transitions

### After the Session
- Provide session recordings promptly
- Follow up on unanswered questions
- Share additional resources
- Collect feedback for improvement
- Connect content to upcoming sessions or assignments

## Asynchronous Learning Enhancement

### Content Design
- Create clear learning paths
- Provide estimated completion times
- Include frequent knowledge checks
- Develop compelling video content under 7 minutes
- Incorporate varied assessment types

### Maintaining Presence
- Regular course announcements
- Personalized feedback on assignments
- Prompt responses to questions
- Weekly summary videos or emails
- Visible activity in discussion forums

### Fostering Interaction
